# Python-Code-Snippets
This is a repo of some useful Python snippets which I frequently use.

I do not own/ did not produce all the code that you see here. Some are my own, some are from the wonderful people on Stackoverflow and GitHub.

Credits to whoever applicable and myself for collating these though for my own future convenience.
